	For extremely light shades of yellow, pink, and green, we can consider the following RGB values. These values are selected to provide a very pale, almost pastel-like appearance for each color.

		Extremely Light Yellow: RGB values often contain high components of red and green, with a touch of blue to maintain a light and soft appearance. A good example would be (255, 255, 224).

		Extremely Light Pink: To achieve an extremely light pink, the RGB values would be high in red with slightly lower values in green and blue. An example is (255, 224, 230).

		Extremely Light Green: For a very light shade of green, the RGB values would be high in green with significant contributions from red and blue to soften the color. A typical example could be (224, 255, 224).
